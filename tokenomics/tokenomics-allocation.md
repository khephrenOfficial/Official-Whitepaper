# Tokenomics Allocation

1.  **Token Sale Allocation:** Token allocation for sale is 24% of total supply or 60,000,000 KPRN, and this is divided into 2 categories and 2 phase rounds.

    ```
    Private Sale Phase 1: 10,000,000 KPRN
    Private Sale Phase 2: 10,000,000 KPRN
    Public Sale Phase 1: 20,000,000 KPRN
    Public Sale Phase 2: 20,000,000 KPRN
    ```
2. **Liquidity Pool Allocation:** A total of 50,000,000 KPRN, or 20% of total supply, will be added as liquidity in pancakeswap to support the trading in the ecosystem on the Khephren token.
3. **Marketing Allocation:** 22,500,000 KPRN, or 9% token allocation. The marketing budget will be used to promote the entire Khephren ecosystem.
4. **Advisor Allocation:** 7,500,000 KPRN, or 3 percent of the overall supply, is provided as part of the project's success to the Khephren team's advisor.
5. **Ecosystem:**  25,000,000 KPRN, or 10% of the entire supply, will be used for ecosystem development for all the project features we'll be releasing, including Launchpad, Staking platform, Launchpad mobile application, reviews/verification website, and future projects like NFT marketplace and DeFi projects.
6. **Rewards & Airdrop:** 22,500,000 KPRN, or 9% of the entire supply, will be allocated for all upcoming events, including giveaways, airdrops, mini-games, and community competitions.
7. **Exchange Fee listing:** Since we are not only targeting the dex exchange but also the centralized exchange, the allotment for this supply, 12,500,000 KPRN, or 5% of the overall supply, will be used for exchange listing, which requires additional payment for listing.
8. **Developers Allocation:** The developers' allocation of 50,000,000 KPRN, or 20% of the entire supply, will be used for impending ecosystem demands and ongoing project development. This can be a project reserve token for future planning of the next project features we will shortly provide.
