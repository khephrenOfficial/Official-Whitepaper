# Introduction

**Khephren** is the new innovative decentralized platform developing and launching a self-served launchpad, staking pool, mobile application for the launchpad, and reviews/verification website. With numerous projects set to launch in the next months, multi-chain support.

As with the web2 era, Khephren feels that embracing web3 blockchain is the best course of action and that this is the future. We still have time to create incredible and beneficial Dapps (web3 applications) for everyone, as blockchain is still in its early stages of development.

There are already 50 team members in Khephren. Each of them has been working in the IT business since 2014 and has continued to advance. They are all experts in developing websites, mobile applications, games, and blockchain web 3.



**Why Khephren?**

We are the first launchpad to pay BNB revenue and offer discounted service costs when you stake KPRN token. Multiple projects with a single native token to be used in the ecosystem. The launchpad with the lowest service fee is Khephren.
