We have 20 members working together to build the project that we're going to launch. All of us have been working in the IT industry since 2014 and are backed up by stable businesses, so we are not dependent on the early success of the Khephren projects. Our team is an expert in this field and knows how to make trustworthy Dapps that the crypto community will use. Our team is also confident in its ability to make this project a success by making a plan for how to keep the ecosystem of khephren projects going.

As with the web2 era, Khephren feels that embracing web3 blockchain is the best course of action and that this is the future. We still have time to create incredible and beneficial Dapps (web3 applications) for everyone, as blockchain is still in its early stages of development.
