# kprnSTAKING

Khephren Staking platform: what is it? Khephren developed a special token and NFT self-served staking platform. We got the idea from Launchpad, where you can create your own launchpad in a few clicks; similarly, here in the staking platform, you can do that as well. You can create your own customized staking in a few clicks and you can select from your project tokens or your NFTs. The exposure from our community's willingness to stake with your token or NFTs will help your community flourish as a result of this.
