### How I become Stakeholder of Khephren project?

1. The first step is to purchase KRPN TOKEN through a token sale or to exchange we are listed.\
   _**Note:** There is a minimum and maximum token to stake please check the table above._\

2. Stake KPRN Token on the official Khephren website and choose which project you want to stake, for example, participation in the krpnPAD project.\
   \
   _**Note:** You can stake in different projects at the same time as long as you have a KPRN token to stake in the project selected to stake._ \
   __
3. After you've decided on a project to stake in, you can choose a tier category (silver, gold, or diamond). Each tier has a minimum and maximum number of KPRN TOKEN that can be staked. Choose a tier from the drop-down menu.
4. After selecting a tier category and successfully staking your KRPN token, your token stake will be locked for 30 days before you can claim your rewards and withdraw from the Stakeholders smart contract.
5. The reward rate will be determined by the project chosen to stake. If you stake in kprnPAD, you will receive a reward based on kprnPAD revenue or profit plus up to 50% discount on service fees.\
