# Khephren Stakeholder

## <mark style="color:orange;">Join to Khephren and become our stakeholder</mark>

All KRPN token holders will benefit from Khephren's debut of the stakeholder feature, which allows them to stake their tokens to earn double rewards from income and profits from selected projects, as well as a 50% reduction in service fees.

### How I become Stakeholder of Khephren project?

1. The first step is to purchase KRPN TOKEN through a token sale.
2. Stake KPRN Token on the official Khephren website and choose which project you want to stake, for example, participation in the krpnPAD project.
3. After you've decided on a project to stake in, you can choose a tier category (silver, gold, or diamond). Each tier has a minimum and maximum number of KPRN TOKEN that can be staked. Choose a tier from the drop-down menu.
4. After selecting a tier category and successfully staking your KRPN token, your token stake will be locked for 30 days before you can claim your rewards and withdraw from the Stakeholders smart contract.
5. The reward rate will be determined by the project chosen to stake. If you stake in kprnPAD, you will receive a reward based on kprnPAD revenue or profit plus a 50% discount on service fees.
