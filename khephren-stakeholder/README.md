# Khephren Stakeholder

## <mark style="color:orange;">Join to Khephren and become our stakeholder</mark>

All KRPN token holders will benefit from Khephren's debut of the stakeholder feature, which allows them to stake their tokens in order to earn double rewards from income and profits from chosen projects, as well as up to a 50% reduction on service fees.

### How I become Stakeholder of Khephren project?

1. The first thing that you need to do is to buy **KRPN TOKEN** from a token sale.
2. Stake KPRN Token to the official website of Khephren and select what project you want to stake, _e.g.,_ Participation in the krpnPAD project.
3. Once you have chosen a project to stake in, there is a tier category to select (silver, gold, diamond). Each tier has a minimum and maximum of KPRN TOKEN to stake. Select a tier from the drop-down menu.
4. After choosing a tier category and successfully staking your KRPN token, the token stake will be locked for a 30 day period before you can claim your rewards and withdraw from the smart contract of Stakeholders.
5. The reward rate will depend on the project selected to stake. _If you stake in kprnPAD, your reward will be based on kprnPAD revenue or profit + up to a 50% discount in service fees._
