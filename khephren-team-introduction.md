# Khephren Team Introduction

Lead by business veterans with at least 20 years of experience. We think that many strong abilities in the economy, business, and technology are linked to the success of crypto projects.

There are already 50 team members in Khephren. Each of them has been working in the IT business since 2014 and has continued to advance. They are all experts in developing websites, mobile applications, games, and blockchain web 3.

The concept originated when we learned about cryptocurrencies and were astounded by how strong the blockchain is, thinking that they would develop into real-world applications and become more beneficial to people outside of crypto

By considering how you can connect blockchain technology with a real-world problem that has to be solved, the Khephren team believes that blockchain technology will be widely used in the future.
